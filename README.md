# Cognitive-Modeling

## Steps 

I am currently using `neuronm` which can be installed by running 
```bash
pip install neurom
```

run `visualizer.py file_name` to visualize the neuron 

## Issues

- Neuron1 and Neuron3 currently cannot be visualized using this.
You can use `https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/morphology-viewer/` to visualize the neuron. 

## Neurons
